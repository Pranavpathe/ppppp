Q1.Write a R program to add, multiply and divide two vectors of integer type.(vector length
should be minimum 4)
vector1 = seq(10,40 , length.out=4) 
vector2 = c(20, 10, 40, 40) 
print("Original Vectors:") 
print(vector1) 
print(vector2) 
add= vector1+vector2 
cat("Sum of vector is ",add, "\n")
sub_vector= vector1-vector2 
cat("Substraction of vector is ",sub_vector, "\n") 
mul_vector= vector1 * vector2 
cat("Multiplication of vector is ",mul_vector, "\n")
print("Division of two Vectors:")
div_vector = vector1 / vector2 
print(div_vector) 

Q2. Write a Python program build Decision Tree Classifier forshows.csvfrom pandas and 
predict class label for show starring a 40 years old American comedian, with 10 
years of experience, and a comedy ranking of 7? Create a csv file as shown in
